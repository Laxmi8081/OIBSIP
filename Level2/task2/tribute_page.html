                    <h2>Father of Indian Constitution</h2>
                       <p>
                          <b>DR. BHIM RAO AMBEDKAR</b>(14 April 1891-6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist,
                           economist, social reformer and political leader who headed the committee drafting the Constitution of 
                           India from the Constituent Assembly debates, served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of 
                           Jawaharlal Nehru, and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement after renouncing Hinduism.

                          After graduating from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, Ambedkar studied economics at Columbia
                           University and the London School of Economics, receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923, respectively, 
                           and was among a handful of Indian students to have done so at either institution in the 1920s.
                            He also trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London. In his early career, he was an economist, professor, 
                            and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning 
                            and negotiations for partition, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, 
                            and contributing to the establishment of the state of India. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism, 
                            initiating mass conversions of Dalits.
                          
                          In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar. 
                          The salutation Jai Bhim (lit. "Hail Bhim") used by followers honours him. He is also referred to by the 
                          nickname Babasaheb (BAH-b…ô SAH-hayb), meaning "Respected Father".
